HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create 
the structure and content of a webpage.

Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.

Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.

Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.

<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.

The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.

Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.

Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.

There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.
